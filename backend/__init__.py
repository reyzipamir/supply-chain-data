"""
Backend package for the supply chain multi agent system.

This package contains all server‑side code including API definitions
and agent logic for forecasting, inventory optimization and replenishment.

The API is built on FastAPI and exposes endpoints for demand forecasting,
multi‑echelon inventory optimization (MEIO), and replenishment planning.
Each endpoint can be consumed independently or orchestrated together to
execute an end‑to‑end pipeline.
